# DeepLink2.0
In this system we have implemented a memory network which serves as a buffer between the distributed database and the deep learning model. The deep learning model is trained using backpropagation to validate transactions in real-time as they come in through the memory network. The memory network stores the most recent transactions for each user in order to provide the deep learning model with the most up-to-date information for validation. The distributed database is used to store completed transactions for future reference and to continuously update the deep learning model with new information. This allows for a fully autonomous and efficient system for transaction validation without the need for human input or bias.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of how the DeepLink nodeless blockchain system with a memory network and deep learning model works:

First, the system needs to be initialized and the memory network needs to be set up. This involves creating a memory network object, initializing it with the desired parameters (such as the size of the memory and the number of hops), and connecting it to the deep learning model.

Next, the system needs to be connected to the distributed database. This can be done by creating a connection to the database and setting up the necessary tables and data structures.

Once the system is connected to the distributed database, it can start processing transactions. When a transaction is received, it is first validated by the deep learning model using the data stored in the memory network. If the transaction is valid, it is added to the memory network and stored in the distributed database.

The deep learning model is constantly training on the data stored in the memory network and the distributed database. As it processes more transactions, it becomes more accurate and efficient at validating them.

The system can also be configured to handle multiple transactions concurrently by using threading or other concurrent processing techniques.
