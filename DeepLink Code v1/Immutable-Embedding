In this example, the deep learning model is used to verify the integrity of the blockchain by analyzing the data in the transactions. This could involve checking the consistency and correctness of the transactions, as well as ensuring that the blocks are properly linked in the chain and that the hashes of the blocks are valid. The model can also be continuously trained on the data being inputted into the blockchain, allowing it to improve over time and make more accurate predictions.
