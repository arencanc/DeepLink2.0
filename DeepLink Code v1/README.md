# AI-Blockchain
The consensus mechanism we created is based on deep learning, a type of artificial intelligence that involves training a model on large amounts of data in order to make predictions or decisions. In the case of our blockchain, the deep learning model is used to validate transactions by analyzing data from previous transactions stored in a Cassandra database. By continuously learning from past data, the model is able to make more accurate and efficient decisions about whether to approve or reject a given transaction.

The blockchain itself is a distributed ledger that allows for the secure and transparent recording of transactions. In our design, the deep learning consensus mechanism serves as the primary means of verifying transactions and adding them to the blockchain. In addition to serving as a record of transactions, the blockchain can also support the execution of smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code.

The system we designed is nodeless, meaning it does not rely on traditional nodes (computing devices connected to the network) to validate and record transactions. Instead, the deep learning model is integrated directly into the blockchain, allowing it to operate autonomously and continuously improve its accuracy over time. This nodeless design makes the system more scalable and efficient, as it does not rely on a fixed number of nodes to process transactions.
